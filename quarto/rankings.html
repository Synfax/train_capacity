<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-does-the-transformation-work">How does the transformation work?</h2>
<p>Each raw score is in different units, so the first task is to transform all the metrics into something that can be summed into one total score.</p>
<p>This is achieved by scaling each column (of all the scores) so that each value is relative to the maximum and minimum values from other stations, also known as xmin-xmax scaling. The end result is a value between zero and 1 across all metrics, allowing an easy summation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x = \frac{x - \min{x} }{ \max{x} - \min{x} }
\]</span></p>
<p>The problem is that some metrics are beneficial, e.g.&nbsp;NRZ/GRZ Percentage. However, some metrics are detrimental, e.g.&nbsp;distance.</p>
<p>To deal with this problem, weights are applied to each metric, with negative weights representing unwanted metrics.</p>
<p>By default, weights are set as:</p>
